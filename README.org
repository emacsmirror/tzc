* About
~tzc~ is a small tool for ~Emacs~ to convert any time from one ~time-zone~ to another ~time-zone~.
- It supports tzdata database, e.g., ~America/New_York~ specifies the ~time-zone~ and daylight saving time history for locations near New York City.
  For more details, see the ~time-zone~ rules as described in the ~Emacs~ manual [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Time-Zone-Rules.html][here.]]
- ~zoneinfo~ could also be any string containg ~+-HHMM~. It also works if the ~timeshift~ is given upto significant places, i. e., without
  the last digits when it is zero. For example, ~+-HH~ or ~+-HHM~ would work. For example instead of ~Asia/Kolkata~ one can use ~UTC+0530~ or
  ~UTC+053~ or ~GM+0530~ or ~GM+053~ and so on.
- A list of all available zones in your system (MacOS (~darwin~) or Linux (~gnu/linux~)) is presented for autocompletion. So you can pick one easily.
- In the unlikely case where a zone is not available in completion, you can add it to the list ~tzc-favourite-time-zones~.
* Installation
~tzc~ is available in [[https://melpa.org/#/tzc][MELPA]]. See the instructions [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][here]] on how to install a [[https://melpa.org/#/tzc][MELPA]] package. If you use ~use-package~ then the following would work
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package tzc
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC
* Customization
You can customize ~tzc-favourite-time-zones-alist~ to set your favourite ~time-zones~ and ~labels~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq tzc-favourite-time-zones-alist '(("UTC+0000" "UTC")
					 ("Asia/Kolkata" "Kolkata")
					 ("America/New_York" "New York")
					 ("UK/London" "London")
					 ("Europe/Berlin" "Berlin")
					 ("Asia/Shanghai" "Shanghai")
					 ("Asia/Tokyo" "Tokyo")))
#+END_SRC
* How to use it
** Convert a time between time zones
To convert a given ~time~ from ~from-zone~ to ~to-zone~, use the interactive function ~tzc-convert-time~.

** Convert a time from one zone to a list of favourite time zones
You can set a list of favourite time zones using the variable ~tzc-favourite-time-zones~ and then use
the interactive function ~tzc-convert-time-to-favourite-time-zones~ to get the time converted to your
favourite time zones.

** Convert and replace time at mark

** World clock
~tzc-world-clock~ is similar to ~world-clock~ but with the extra feature that with ~n~ (next) or ~p~ ("previous") key it will change the information on the buffer for the next or previous hours. Pressing ~g~ reverts it back to the current time.
